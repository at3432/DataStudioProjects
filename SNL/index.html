      <p class="body-text serif">Cast members in <i>Saturday Night Live</i> come and go more frequently than the women in the chorus of Feeltwood Mac's 'Dreams' on repeat. Although securing a spot in the cast is a daunting task, keeping it doesn't always guarantee a prominent presence.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">Many comedy legends, from Chevy Chase to Bill Murray and from Gilda Radner to Tina Fey made a name for themselves as cast members of the show, but over its 45 years on the air, SNL has one star that, like Rose in <i>Titanic</i>, will never let go. Kenan Thompson's job security has become its own joke.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">Women in SNL</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">While SNL has been the starting ground for the careers of successful female comedians such as Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Amy Poehler, the aforementioned Fey and the Oscar-nominated Kristen Wiig, it has a somewhat problematic history of letting its female cast members share in the glory of their male counterparts. The question "are women funny?" has plagued the comedy world for too many decades, and despite the genuine sense of discovery and support it has provided for some of its female cast members, the numbers show that SNL hasn't given them an equally visible platform.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">In fact, you'd have to go all the way to the 13th place to come across the first woman in the list of most frequently featured cast members in weekly episodes. That woman is Vanessa Bayer, and she is followed by Poehler, Wiig and Rachel Dratch - and they are all post-2000s additions to the cast.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">SNL's character work</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">Even before the age of memes, GIFs, Twitter and YouTube videos, the impressions of real-life figures, mostly artists and politicians, from the SNL comedians were instant classics in their majority, as well as widely discussed. Many of them are ingrained in popular culture and have played a role in shaping the public profile of the object of the impression in irreversible ways.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The following chart on the left shows which are the personalities whose impressions SNL has loved returning to. Note that Donald Trump, who has featured heavily in the last 2 seasons of the show, is absent, because he is portrayed by a non-regular cast member, guest star Alec Baldwin.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">And on the right, maybe the actual most loved (by SNL itself) SNL cast members are revealed, since these are the actors who have generated the most characters (be it original or impressions). Many of these characters, like Bill Hader's Stefon, of Wiig's Target Lady, are in some corners more famous than the actors that portrayed them.</p>
