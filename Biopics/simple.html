      <h1 class="headline">Most Picked for Biopics</h1>
      <h2 class="subhead">Which historical figures are repeatedly given the biopic treatment by Hollywood?</h2>

    <div class="story-body">
      <p class="body-text">It often seems like the biographical movie is the safest road towards awards glory for most actors, either they are newcomers lucky enough to take their careers to the next level with a baity part (hello, Rami Malek) or respectable veterans who have spent too much time watching their mantelpiece gathering dust while it waits for a shiny new addition - the shiniest of them all. And while the death of the original, mid-budget, non-sequel/remake/superhero film is increasingly becoming a disturbing trend in Hollywood, the biographical drama is one of the few survivors of the Old Way Of Doing Things when it comes to studios' green lights. A resilient genre, the biopic has proved to be accessible for audiences ever since the nascent years of American filmmaking and it remains reliant and popular to this very day.</p>
      <p class="body-text">But despite their abundance over the years, biopics remain concerned with the lives of major personalities, rarely choosing to spotlight a lesser known but interesting real-life figure who is not instantly recognisable by the public. As a commercial strategy, it seems like a no-brainer, but, looking at the wider picture, it has created an odd repetition when it comes to the films' subjects.</p>

      <p class="body-text"> Jesus is not only the most commonly revisited historical figure in Hollywood movies, but his staying power remains unwavering: the last Jesus-centric "event" film, Mel Gibson's 2004 epic The Passion Of The Christ, grossed $612 million worldwide, and retained its spot as the highest-grossing non-English language film of all time until 2017.</p>
      <p class="body-text">As for the actors chasing the aforementioned highest acclaim, the very meme-able (until his win in 2017 for The Revenant) Leonardo DiCaprio sits at the top as the most real-life-figure-friendly thespian (a fact partially explained, perhaps, by his continuous bids for Oscar gold), closely followed by Denzel Washington, who for decades was the most bankable black dramatic actor, therefore the immediate choice to portray important African American personalities - a move that ensured some kind of representation in less enlightened times.</p>
