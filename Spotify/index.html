      <h1 class="headline">In Spotify, Sort Of Like In Tolstoy, All Happy Songs Sound The Same</h1>
      <h2 class="subhead">A closer look at the 100 most popular songs on a global level on Spotify reveals just how much listeners gravitate towards a sound that is aggressively feelgood - but ultimately repetitive.</h2>

      <p class="body-text serif">“Happiness is a warm gun” the Beatles declared rather controversially half a century ago - but looking at the most popular songs from the world’s top streaming service, it seems like that phrase could be translated into something even scarier: happiness is an Ed Sheeran song, Spotify seems to be telling us.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Based on the list of the world’s top 100 most streamed songs on Spotify in 2018 and data on their audio features provided by the service itself, the key value that measures the “positive” mood of a song -valence- can be found in spades in Sheeran’s ubiquitous mega-hit “Shape Of You”, which is crowned as the happiest song among those on the top 100.

        <p class="chart-subhead">Measured by valence, i.e. the platform's audio feature which determines a song's positivity</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">What do audio features mean?</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">Along with more traditional information and metrics. Spotify provides additional data for analysis of its vast library, should one be inclined to go down that rabbit hole. Audio features, such as danceability, tempo, energy, loudness and the aforementioned valence, are particularly ripe for comparison, albeit somewhat obscure in meaning.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Thankfully, all are explained by the streamer itself, which has determined each songs audio feature as follows:<ul><li>Danceability: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.</li><li>Energy: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.</li><li>Key: The key the track is in.</li><li>Loudness: The overall loudness of a track in decibels.</li><li>Mode: The modality (major or minor) of a track.</li><li>Speechiness: The presence of spoken words in a track.</li><li>Acousticness: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. </li><li>Instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals.</li><li>Liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. </li><li>Tempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). </li></ul> </p>

      <div class="chart-section">
        <p class="chart-title">How all the audio features correlate</p>
        <p class="chart-subhead">The heatmap below shows the correlation among all audio features in 2018's top 100 tracks.</p>
        <div class="chart-row">

        </div>
        <p class="chart-source">Source: Spotify</p>
      </div>

      <p class="body-text serif">The heatmap indicates that among all features, loudness and energy are the ones most closely related, with a value of 0.73 (the closer two values get to 1.0, the stronger the correlation between them is.) It makes sense that loud songs are naturally more energetic. Danceability and valence also seem to be quite entwined, but as much as one would expect. Are danceable songs not as happy as we normally assume?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="story-body">
      <!-- <h3 class="section-head serif">Another section head</h3> -->
      <p class="body-text serif"> The answer lies in the three charts below, which show the connection between key values. It does look like energy and loudness trump valence when it comes to danceability, so next time you're sweating on the dancefloor, think that it won't necessarily mean that you are making <i>happy</i> moves (although it's safe to assume you won't be thinking of any of that stuff while you're on the actual dancefloor.)</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">Although Ed Sheeran is not even one of the two artists with most songs on the top 100 (those would be Post Malone and the late XXXTENTACION), his compositions seem to be the golden standard. Despite their seemingly "lighter" production which makes his songs sound not as overloaded in the studio as other chart hits, Sheeran's songs present the highest correlation among key values compared to any other top artist on the list.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">When it comes to other top artists, the songs of the champion of the list, Post Malone, have a rare strong correlation between acousticness and danceability, which seems to be quite on-brand for one of the biggest breakout singers of the last 5 years. XXXTENTACION, the rapper whose music shot to the top after his untimely death in 2018, has songs with mild correlation between valence and acousticness and energy and loudness, a fact not too strange given the genre he was representing. Drake's songs, on the other hand, are a perfect match of acousticness and energy</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Given the massive appeal of these artists around the world, it seems like people just want to dance their troubles away. Contrary to everything else on that list, this trend didn't originate in 2018...</p>
